# DisparityEstimation
A small project I did for my 3rd year Computer Vision module that uses 2 images to estimate the disparity between them.


**OnATree** is the disparity/dynamic programming on a tree technique. Sadly, given the time constraints and complexity of this technique, it was not finished before the submission. As such the **Standard** method was also created.

**Standard** is the 'typical' disparity estimation technique that was typically used.

### Report

For this project I also wrote a report detailing my findings and comparisons of the techniques. As well as my masthematical understanding of the **OnATree** technique. This report is available upon request.
